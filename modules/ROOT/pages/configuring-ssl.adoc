= Configuring SSL
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
One of the core features of Couchbase Server is support for encryption of data over the wire between the client and the cluster.
This is done through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

You can use SSL to secure the data that moves between your application and the cluster.

To use SSL, you need to install an SSL certificate obtained from Couchbase Server on your application server and then configure the client.

== Installing the SSL certificate

To obtain and install the SSL certificate:

. Open a browser and navigate to the Couchbase Web Console of the cluster to which you want to connect your client.
. Click menu:Settings[Cluster].
. In the Configuration section, click [.ui]*Show* to display the certificate.

. Copy the entire content of the certificate and store it in a file with a .crt extension on the application server on which you want to install the certificate.
. After you have the certificate on the application server, you need to import it into the local computer certificate store.
On Windows, you can do this by using the certificate MMC snap-in, [.cmd]`certlm`.

. Under the Trusted Root Certification Authorities root node, right-click menu:Certificates[Import].
. Follow the wizard to import the certificate you stored on disk.

== Configuring the client

After you have the certificate installed on your application server, to enable SSL on the client either set the `UseSsl` property on the `ClientConfiguration` or `BucketConfiguration` to true.
Alternatively, you can set the `UseSsl` property within your [.path]_Web.Config_ or [.path]_App.Config_ if you are not doing your configuration programmatically.
