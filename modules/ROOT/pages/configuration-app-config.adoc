= Connecting to buckets
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
After you create a `ClientConfiguration`, you can then connect to a cluster by using the `Cluster` class.

To connect to a bucket, create a `Cluster` object and pass the `ClientConfiguration` object as a parameter, as shown in the following example:

[source,csharp]
----
  var config = new ClientConfiguration
  {
    Servers = new List<Uri>
    {
      new Uri("http://192.168.56.101:8091/pools"),
      new Uri("http://192.168.56.102:8091/pools"),
      new Uri("http://192.168.56.103:8091/pools"),
      new Uri("http://192.168.56.104:8091/pools"),
    }
  };

  using (var cluster = new Cluster(config))
  {
    //open buckets here
  }
----

The default constructor allocates a `ClientConnection` internally with the default settings.
Creating a `ClientConfiguration` object is required only when you want to override the default settings.

Now that we have a `Cluster` object, we can connect to a bucket by calling the [.api]`Cluster.OpenBucket()` method.
The default [.api]`OpenBucket()` method connects to the default bucket.
If you want to open a different bucket, use one of the overloads that take a bucket name and password.
It’s important to note that you do not need to provide a bucket configuration to open another bucket; if one doesn’t exist, the client will clone one from the default configuration.

[source,csharp]
----
  using (var cluster = new Cluster(config))
  {
      using (var bucket = cluster.OpenBucket())
      {
          //use bucket here
      }
  }
----

When you call `OpenBucket()`, internally the client is using the configuration provided to establish the connection between the client and the server.
The references are maintained by the `Cluster` object; it’s the root object and should be long-lived and reused within your application.
