:navtitle: Using Scan Consistency
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can balance performance against consistency in N1QL queries via the Couchbase .NET client and the AtPlus option.

Setting a https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/architecture/querying-data-with-n1ql.html#story-h2-2[Scan Consistency^], lets you choose between NotBounded (the default), for sharpest performance; RequestPlus, for strongest consistency; and AtPlus, for a good balance between increased performance and completeness of results.

In order to use `at_plus`, you'll need to make sure that you explicitly set `UseEnhancedDurability` to `true` when setting up your *ClientConfiguration*:

----
config.BucketConfigs = new Dictionary<string, BucketConfiguration> {
    {
        "travel-sample", new BucketConfiguration
        {
            UseEnhancedDurability = true
        }
    }
};
----

In the example below, the N1QL query will wait only for the new document to be indexed.

.Setting at_plus consistency
[source,csharp]
----
private static void AtPlusExample()
{
    Console.WriteLine("========= AtPlus");

    // get the current count
    var getResult = _bucket.Query<dynamic>("SELECT COUNT(1) as airportCount FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type='airport'")
            .Rows.First();
    Console.WriteLine($"Initial count: {result1.airportCount}");

    // insert a new airport
    var doc = new Document<dynamic>
    {
        Id = "ScanConsistency::airport::" + _random.Next(10000),
        Content = new
        {
            type = "airport"
        }
    };
    var insertResult = _bucket.Insert(doc);

    // get the count again, creating mutation state from insert result
    var state = MutationState.From(insertResult.Document);
    var request = new QueryRequest("SELECT COUNT(1) as airportCount FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type='airport'")
        .ConsistentWith(state);
    var queryResult = _bucket.Query<dynamic>(t).Rows.First();
    Console.WriteLine($"Count after insert with AtPlus: {result2.airportCount}");
}
