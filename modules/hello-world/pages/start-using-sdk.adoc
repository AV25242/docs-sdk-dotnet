= Install and Start Using the .NET SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Start Using the SDK

[abstract]
The Couchbase .NET SDK enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from the .NET Framework using C#.
It offers both a traditional synchronous API and an asynchronous API based on the _Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)_.

== Installing the SDK

These pages cover the first _Developer Preview_ of the Couchbase .NET SDK 3.0 (DP1).
As such they are likely to change without notice.
The DP1 code _should not_ be used in production.
