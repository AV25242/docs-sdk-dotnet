Couchbase Data Platform can store documents compressed with Snappy. 

IMPORTANT: The .NET SDK does not support Snappy compression. 

The .NET SDK operates with compression mode set to `OFF`.
This means that any compressed documents stored in Couchbase Server will be presented to the SDK in uncompressed form.
More information is available in the xref:3.0@java-sdk:concept-docs:compression.adoc[Compression documentation] of the other SDKs.
