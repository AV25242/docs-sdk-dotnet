= Working with documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Couchbase Server is a document database at its core.
Keys and values are stored as JSON documents if they are in fact valid JSON; otherwise, they are stored as binary blobs.

In most cases you will want to store documents as JSON.
To make it easier to work with JSON documents, we added document-centric APIs to our SDKs.
This section contains information about storing, deleting, and retrieving documents using these APIs.
