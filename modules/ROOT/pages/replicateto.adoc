= Ensuring Durability with ReplicateTo
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Similar to how PersistTo works, you can use ReplicateTo enum to ensure that a key has been replicated to "n" nodes before a write is considered successful.

== Example: using ReplicateTo

Here is an example of replicating to two (2) nodes in a four (4) node cluster:

[source,csharp]
----
    private static async Task<bool> InsertWithReplicateTo(Post value)
    {
        var result = await _bucket.UpsertAsync(value.PostId, value, Couchbase.ReplicateTo.Two);
        if (result.Success)
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
----

In this case, we do not care about persistence, just that the key has been replicated to at least two (2) nodes in the cluster.
Note that the trade-off of using ReplicateTo on a write is availability at the expense of latency, since it takes a bit longer to ensure that the key has replicated to each of the specified nodes.
