= Retrieving documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Documents are retrieved by unique identifier (key).
You can retrieve documents by using consistent reads from the primary cluster node or inconsistent reads from replicas.

== Regular reads

In most cases you can use regular reads for accessing your documents in Couchbase Server.
In this case the client  reads from the primary cluster node.

There are two methods defined (with many overloads) for reading documents.
The first one takes the unique identifier of the document and returns an `IOperationResult<T>` object and the other takes the unique identifier and returns an `IDocumentResult<T>` object.
Here is an example of using the latter:

[source,csharp]
----
  var result = bucket.GetDocument<Person>("P1");
  if (result.Success)
  {
      var person = result.Content;
      Console.WriteLine("Retrieved document '{0}': {1} {2}", id, person.FirstName, person.LastName);
  }
----

The two perform essentially the same purpose; they retrieve a document from Couchbase by ID and cast the value to specified Type T.
The `IDocumentResult<T>` and `IOperationResult<T>` interfaces are nearly symmetric.
They both offer properties for checking whether or not the operation completed successfully (`Success`) and if the operation failed the serverâ€™s response status (`Status`) and an optional message with reason why.

Here is a table that describes the `IDocumentResult<T>` interface:

.IDocumentResult<T> properties
[cols="50,83,193"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `Status`
| ResponseStatus*
| The memcached response status from the server

| `Content`
| IDocument<T>
| A type constrained representing a JSON document

| `Message`
| string
| The message returned by the server or the client if the request could not be satisfied

| `Success`
| Boolean
| True if the request was successful
|===

== Replica reads

In certain cases when availability is favored over consistency, replica reads can be used.
A replica read returns data from the non-authoritative location (a node other than its master).
