= Deleting documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Documents are deleted by unique-identifier (`Id`) or by passing the document to be deleted into the [.api]`IBucket.Remove(..)` method

[source,csharp]
----
 var result = bucket.Remove(document);
 if(result.Success)
 {
    Console.WriteLine("Deleted document '{0}'", document.Id);
 }
----

As always, the `Success` property returns true if the deletion was successful.
